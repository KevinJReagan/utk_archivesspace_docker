Students (properly called cadets) were taught by Army officers and required to wear uniforms, abide by military regulations, and endure military forms of punishment when they broke the rules. Charles W. Dabney began reorganizing the University when he assumed the Presidency in 1887 and the military regime was significantly relaxed. The military department remained strong, however, and students engaged in competitive drills, staged battles (including the Campaign of '92, in which one group of cadets attacked the Hill while another defended it), and artillery instruction. The Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) was organized in 1916, and UT's cadet corps became a senior unit in the new organization. The program was compulsory until 1967, when voluntary 2- and 4-year programs replaced the freshman-sophomore requirement.\n\n","jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"117b16913a46fc0944bc9c104af7ad6d","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","label":"Scope and Contents Note","subnotes":[{"content":"This collection houses morning reports, absence reports, accounts of military offences, notes, grade books, and other materials documenting the University of Tennessee's Military Department between 1889 and 1917.\n\n","jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true}],"type":"scopecontent","persistent_id":"0f178d1ad53f1b8d0eb9ebc817b20270","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","label":"Arrangement","subnotes":[{"content":"This collection consists of three boxes divided into two series:\n\n","jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true},{"enumeration":"null","items":["Series I: Student Discipline, 1889-1916","Series II: Department Business, 1896-1917"],"jsonmodel_type":"note_orderedlist","publish":true,"title":"Missing Title"}],"type":"arrangement","persistent_id":"f20f67a61f9f9e0a5b2865ac1a0e8845","publish":true}],"uri":"/repositories/2/resources/26","repository":{"ref":"/repositories/2"},"tree":{"ref":"/repositories/2/resources/26/tree"}}
