It was administered by U.T. in partnership with the University of Panama and the University of San Andres in La Paz, Bolivia.  Its goal was to teach the residents of Panama and Bolivia the skills they needed to participate effectively in their respective governments.  Staff from U.T. travelled to both countries, where they taught agriculture (Panama only), political science, public administration, office management, and library science.  Students from both Panama and Bolivia travelled to the U.S. to study at the University level.  Lee S. Greene served as Home Staff Coordinator at U.T. and was assisted by numerous field administrators, including Robert S. Avery and Nelson M. Robinson of the Political Science Department, Dr. John Conrad of the School of Agriculture, and Dr. Joseph Starr.  The Bolivia segment of the program ended in 1961; U.T. staff were forced out of Panama in 1963 due to a climate of political uncertainty and unrest.","jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true}],"type":"bioghist","persistent_id":"73c62da637bf799050ca567a6d544dfa","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","label":"Arrangement","subnotes":[{"content":"This collection consists of 38 boxes divided into four series:","jsonmodel_type":"note_text","publish":true},{"enumeration":"null","items":["Series I: Project Files Generated by Staff in Panama","Series II: Project Files Regarding Panama Kept in Knoxville","Series III: Records Regarding Bolivia","Series IV: Other Records Regarding Panama"],"jsonmodel_type":"note_orderedlist","publish":true,"title":"Missing Title"}],"type":"arrangement","persistent_id":"b606d39c7d8451122fd61fe375faee86","publish":true},{"jsonmodel_type":"note_multipart","label":"File Plan","subnotes":[{"content":"The original file numbers assigned to the folders in Series I have been left intact.
